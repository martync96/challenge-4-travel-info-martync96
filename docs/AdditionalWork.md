# Future Improvements 

## Integration with other DFCorp Applications
Under it's umbrella, DFcorp has there other applications, an application for the landing of airplanes, a banking application and a contact list application. This section will outline some potential uses that those applications could bring through implementation if DFcorp's weather application.
DFcorp's banking application could be implemented with this weather application to allow users to easily pay for hotels found by the application, this would bring a great benefit to the user of allowing for seamless payment, which for DFcorp would bring the benefit of keeping user's in the DFcorp eco-system and retain customers across multiple apps, which allows for DFcorp to have multiple revenue streams and streams of data which can be used to improve the apps, to further improve and to use for monetary benefits, legality permitting.

## External APIs
Naturally, there is a mind-boggling amount of APIs that be be implemented into the application with their practically being an API for everything now, but there are a few that stick out. 
Firstly, the implementation of an aviation data API could be pursued, one API that stands out in particular is that of SkyScanner. The Skyscanner API could be combined with the weather location and hotel apps and allow users to see real-time streaming of prices, the benefits that this functionality could bring to DFcorp is additional revenue streams, particularly if the previously mentioned banking implementation was performed. In addition to the revenue stream, yet another stream of data could be secured to allow for the training of models to analyse user behaviours, such as where users look for flights, what months and for how long which could allow DFcorp to send marketing emails to encourage spending in line with customer behaviours. It would also add the benefit of having data to sell to partners such as Skycanner who may find the data useful.
Secondly, keeping in life with the idea of adding more travel/holidays it would be possible to implement some foreign currency exchange APIs, with additional functionality pertaining to forex, in combination with the bank application and flight APIs it would further solidify the ecosystem and increase customer retention and therefore revenue as if the purchasing of hotels/flights and forex is as seamless as possible then customers are more likely to use the singular app due to convenince,
