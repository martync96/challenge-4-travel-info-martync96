## Core Features

The Business Analyst team working with DFCorp has identified the following features that should be implemented:

- The user should see a location search box when they access the application home page that allows them to search any town or city by name (as per the wireframe supplied)
- The application should send a query to a weather API to get a 5-day forecast if the location can be found
- When the forecast data is returned, a new view should be displayed, using the wireframe(s) for the view layout
- The user should be able to save a location as a favourite (although this should only persist on the device they are using at the time)
- The application should be responsive across the main breakpoints for devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) - wireframes are provided for each of these

The layouts are pretty much agreed with the main stakeholder but they are open for you to put your creative flair into the colour scheme and any images used (that are not specific to the location content).  They are also open to suggestions for the name of the application and its logo.

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to complete tasks relating to the specific requirements above is NOT allowed.  All work here should be your own.

## Additional Features

In addition to these features, should time allow, the client has asked for the application to display the following on the same view as the weather (as per the wireframes):

- A map of the selected location
- A list of hotels in the selected location, displayed on a carousel that can be moved on; Hotel images should be in a slide show within the hotel's carousel.

Please see the wireframes for more information about the specific data and layout to be used to base your application on

> **Note:** The use of a generative AI tool to help complete tasks relating to these further requirements is allowed but should be clearly documented.
